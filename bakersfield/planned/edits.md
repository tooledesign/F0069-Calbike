Issues with Class 1 cycleways/ shared use paths

~~Norris Road Rails to Trails Shared Use Path (from east to west)~~
1.	~~Missing connection near Norris Road and California St~~
2.	~~Missing connection with Oildale Dr.~~
3.	~~Missing connection with Yosemite Drive~~
4.	~~Missing connection with Sequoia Ave~~
~~Jewett Ave and Kern River Bike Path Connector~~


1.	~~The separated bikeway going from the Kern River Bike Path to near the intersection of Jewett Ave and West Columbus street is missing a node at the bike path. ~~

~~Mill Creek Canal shared use path (heads south from Mill Creek Park)~~
1.	~~Lots of missing nodes between California Ave and 4th St~~
o	~~Near 11th and Q~~
o	~~10th St and the canal path~~
o	~~R St and the canal path~~
o	~~6th Street and the canal path~~
2.	~~N St and the canal path~~
3.	~~Missed connecting node with East Belle Terrace Bike Blvd~~
4.	~~Terrace Way and the canal path~~

~~The Bike/ped bridge from the Kern River Bike Path to Riverside Dr. (located just north of where 24th St crosses the Kern River)~~
1.	~~This path is not showing up at all. It could be due to missing nodes or a mistake I made tagging a bridge over the Kern River~~

~~The bike/ped bridge over the Kern River just west of the 99~~
1.	~~There's no action to take here besides to note that this bridge is useless unless it connects to the street network north of the river. To note for potential proposed network improvements~~

~~The connection between the Kern River Bike path and Loma Linda Dr.~~

1.	~~I think there's a missing node between this connection and the Kern River Bike Path~~

~~178 Bike/Ped Bridge west of Mt. Vernon~~

1.	~~I am not sure if this got added to OSM after you pulled the network or if the tag highway=path is causing the issue. In either case, it's not showing up on the network at all.~~

~~The Shared Use path along the canal beginning at 19th St west of Oak St and extending west beyond the study area~~
1.	~~I had mentioned that this was missing. I believe it's missing because it goes such a long distance without connecting to any other streets that it doesn't affect connectivity within the 1.6 mile distance. That said, is it useful to still show in the BNA outputs? I am not worried about this path too much.~~

Issues with Class 4 cycletracks / Protected Bike Lanes

~~Olive Drive Protected Bike Path~~
1.	~~The western edge of the path, there is a node missing between the bikeway and Victor Street.~~

~~21st Street Protected Bike Lanes~~
1.	~~it was my intention for every intersection between Oak St and F St (all the residential streets) should be connected to the cycle track/protected bike lanes on 21st. Instead, none of those intersections received a node showing a connection. I would like each of these streets to be a low stress connection between the protected bike lanes and the north/south residential streets.~~

Issues with Bike Boulevards

K Street Bike Boulevard

The issue with the K Street Bike Boulevard at the Garces circle we discussed.

1. ~~The Golden State hwy ramps that are currently one way are to be vacated.~~~~
1. The bikeway connection going around Garces Circle needs to be a bidirectional low-stress connection.

~~22nd Street Bike Blvd~~

2.	~~Doesn't cross over Chester Ave~~

~~17th Street Bike Blvd~~
3.	~~I missed tagging as LTS=low and Bike=designated at the intersection Chester Ave. Please make 17th street a continuous low stress connection on either side of Chester Ave.~~

~~King St Bike Blvd~~
4.	~~I did not tag LTS=low for the King St Bike Blvd south of Brundage lane because I clipped my OSM extract there. Please extend the LTS = low tag for King St south to East Planz Rd. I had forgotten about the 1.6 mile buffer beyond the study area being in the analysis and I know that will affect the results along that corridor.~~

~~2nd St to Bank St Bike Blvd~~

1.	~~I missed tagging a bike blvd extending (east to west)~~
2.	~~2nd Street to H St~~
3.	~~H st from 2nd St to Bank St (one block)~~
4.	~~Bank St from H St all the way west until Oak St~~

~~Ls France Dr Bike Blve~~
1.	~~Missed connection to the canal path near H St.~~

Other Issues

For Forest to validate (but go ahead and consider the changes to the proposed network complete as I'm nearly certain these won't change what's already in the BNA low stress network).
1.	30th St bike blvd does not connect through to the K St Bike blvd and ends at the Garces Circle. Look back at the planning documents and validate
2.	30th Street and Jewett don't connect further south. They are not planned to, but keep this in mind for proposed connections\
3.	I may have missed the class 1 shared use path that is being constructed adjacent to the hwy 58 freeway construction. I will see if I have and include it if so.
